# Write a code to simulate dice-rolling. Since rolling of a dice is a random event and can result
# in any values from 𝑥 = 1 to 𝑥 = 6, you may want to use the random module in your code.
# Include in your code the number of times a particular face (e.g., 𝑥 = 1) will appear when the
# dice is rolled 𝑛 ∈ {10, 100, 10000} times. Write a function to calculate the probability that the
# observed face is 𝑥 ∈ {1, 3, 6}. Output the probability values as the increasing of the sample size
# 𝑛 ∈ {10, 100, 10000}. Fill the following table with your results.
